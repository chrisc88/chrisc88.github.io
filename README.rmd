Hello and welcome to my resume and portfolio page! 

Originally, I set out with the goal of finding a way to provide you with an easily accessible and shareable form of my resume and portfolio.  In doing so, I found myself exploring and learning Github and Git Pages for the first time.

Within this repository, you will find a couple pages which are outlined below.
- **[Resume](https://chrisc88.github.io/Resume):** Provides a web-based version of my resume that I encourage you share!
- **[Portfolio](https://chrisc88.github.io/Portfolio):** Features or bodies of work which I have been a key contributor. Most of these samples are pulled from a testing environment or directly from Prod (masked sensitive data).

Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to learn a little bit about me.  

Best,

Christopher Cooper
