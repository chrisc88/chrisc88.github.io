My goal for this project is to provide you with an easily accessible and shareable form of my resume.  In doing so, I found myself exploring and learning Github and Git Pages for the first time.

Within this repository, you will find a couple pages which are outlined below.
- **Resume:** Provides a web-based version of my resume that I encourage you share!
- **Portfolio:** Features or snippets of work which I have been a key contributor to. Most of these samples are pulled from a RC testing environment or directly from Prod (masked sensitive data).

Thank you for taking the time to visit and please reach out if you feel I can add value to your team!
