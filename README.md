---------

My goal of this project is to provide an easily accessible form of my resume.  In doing so, I found myself exploring Git Pages for the first time.
---------

Within this repository, you will find a couple pages which are outlined below.
- **Resume:** Provides a web-based version of my resume that I encourage you share!
- **Portfolio:** Features or snippets of work which I have been a key contributor to. These samples have either been masked to hide sensitive data, or were pulled directly from a RC testing environment which the data is simulated. 

Thank you for taking the time to visit and please reach out if you feel I can add value to your team!
