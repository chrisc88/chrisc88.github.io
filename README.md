Hello and welcome to my resume and portfolio page! 

My name is Christopher Cooper, I am a father to the most amazing son in the world.  If we are not out shredding the finest trails that Florida has to offer, then we are *attempting* to expand our talents in the finer things life has to offer, such as water coloring. 

From a growth and personal development perspective, I am currently reading Greenlights by Matthew McConaughey, working through a Google certification on Data Analytics, and learning about WordPress, WooCommerce, and drop-shipping.

Originally, I set out with the goal of finding a way to provide you with an easily accessible and shareable form of my resume and portfolio.  In doing so, I found myself exploring and learning Github and Git Pages for the first time.

Within this repository, you will find a couple pages which are outlined below.
- **[Resume](https://chrisc88.github.io/Resume):** Provides a web-based version of my resume that I encourage you share!
- **[Portfolio](https://chrisc88.github.io/Portfolio):** Features or bodies of work which I have been a key contributor. Most of these samples are pulled from a testing environment or directly from Prod (masked sensitive data).

Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to learn a little bit about me.  Please reach out if you feel I can add value to your team!

Best,
Christopher Cooper
